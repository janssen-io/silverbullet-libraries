# Logseq Theme
This theme is a work in progress and inspired by the theme of Logseq.

I try to document the theme as much as possible by using headings and
description between the space style blocks.

Inside the `theme` directory are the space-styles for the sidebar treeview
provided by the plug:

```
- github:joekrill/silverbullet-treeview/treeview.plug.js
```

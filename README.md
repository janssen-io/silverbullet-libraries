# SilverBullet Libraries

This is my collection of themes (`space-style`), commands and functions (`space-script`),
and snippets and templates for [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md).

You can either manually download them and copy them into your space or use my plug (‚ö†Ô∏è Work In Progress):
[SilverBullet üîå: GitHub Libraries](https://github.com/janssen-io/silverbullet-github-libraries-plug).

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own libraries via a Pull Request or by opening an
issue.

1. New Libraries **MUST** be placed in the `Library` folder
2. `index.json` **MUST not** need to be updated manually. The workflow will
    automatically update this file when changes are pushed to main.
3. Libraries **MUST** contain some form of documentation. Either as a separate
   README.md in the root of the library folder or as part of one of the library
   pages.
4. Files that are not relevant to be downloaded into a space **MUST** be added
   to `ignore.txt`
